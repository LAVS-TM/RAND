RAND is a repository for a sport **dataset analysis** made with the language **R**. The analysis is done in `Projet_final_Lemonnier_Alexandre_Simonin_Victor.ipynb` with a dataset description, some **statistical analysis**, **visualisation**, a **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis ) and finally a **logistic regression**.


## Dataset

The dataset is here in `/data/decathlon.csv`. The dataset is made up of several quite different pieces of data. These represent the scores obtained by athletes in the **decathlon** event at the **Olympic Games** and at the **Decastar**, we have the scores of the 10 events as well as their ranking and their points.
