RAND is a repository for a sport **dataset analysis** made with the language **R**. The analysis is done in `Projet_final_Lemonnier_Alexandre_Simonin_Victor.ipynb` with a dataset description, some **statistical analysis**, **visualisation**, a **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis ) and finally a **logistic regression**.


## Dataset

The OCR contains a CLI tool which is used to demonstrate the **segmentation** part of the project.

### Usage

```bash
make
./src/main
```

The trash files produced by the compilation could be removed by :

```bash
make clean
```

or

```bash
make properclean
```

## Interface

The interface is made with SDL 2.0, it's a really simple component that need to be refactored. Here is a diagram that demonstrate its usability.
